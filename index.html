          This is the journey of becoming the new me what I have wished for a
          long time but couldn't do due to lots of excuses with some ralities in
          life. But 2022 has to be time and I have finally started the journey.

          <h3>Mission</h3>

          <p>
            My aim is to focus on just learning by following the guideline of
            the course and do coding every single day even if it is for an hour
            or to learn even the smallest thing one can learn to myself in the
            zone of practice. I know PROBLEMS will come as it is as basic as
            BREATHING...!!!!

            alt="illustrator-2"
          />
          <h3>Vision</h3>
          <p>
            All I want to see myself in a state of NOT GIVING UP..!!I am not
            from the IT sector but I have absolutely damn passionate about it. I
            don't understand so many things easily & it's completely fine. Thats
            why I always have to put more effort to understand things. So, I
            won't stop until I understand...

            alt="illustrator-3"
          />
          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>
            The goal is to be confident in myself as a new coder go for jub
            hunting in 2023 which will be the greatest transition in my life. I
            know it won't be easy but life never was..!! So, I am not looking
            for an easy escape rather I want to prepare myself as much I can
            learn and express the potential I have.

        <h1>Only my Imagination is my Limit</h1>
        <p>
          Being self-confident, focused and motivated is not the easiest of our
          abilities. And I want remind myself that it is hard but I should focus
          more on the journey than the destination. Nothing can be more
          dangerous than having low self-esteem.

          Sharing the knowledge with others is the best way to learn. Noting ca
          be better than this in terms of creating an environment of passive
          learning where anyone can join and expand the horizons or creativity.
